   - Build the project by running:

2. **Create the Environment File:**
   - In the project root, create a `.env` file with the following content:
   
     ```env
     SMTP_USER=<your_email@gmail.com>
     SMTP_NAME=<your_name>
     SMTP_PASS=<your_app_pass>   # Use a Gmail app password instead of your regular Gmail password!

     Use the following snippet in your terminal to load the environment variables:
     
     ```fish
     for line in (cat .env)
         if not string match -qr '^#' $line
             set parts (string split "=" $line)
             set -gx $parts[1] $parts[2]
         end
